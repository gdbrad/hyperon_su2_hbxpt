Project for determining the hyperon spectrum by fitting $`\chi`$PT mass extrapolation formulae.

For details on how the first part of this analysis is conducted, fitting the raw hyperon correlation functions, see [Corr Fitter](https://github.com/gerbradl/corr_fitter)

For details on how the scale setting is performed, see [Scale setting](https://github.com/callat-qcd/project_scale_setting_mdwf_hisq)
