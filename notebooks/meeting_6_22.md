My remaining todos:

- Everyone who fit all the correlators make their own bs file, then i can compare extrapolation results?

- $M_H /\Lambda_\Chi$ fits look ok  however, Need to simultaneously fit w/$F_\pi$ to disentangle some lecs 
- strangeness sigma terms (will need a cross check for chiral expansion for each hyperon after applying FH theorem and makingm the replacement:
 
    $m_s -> m_k^2 - m_\pi^2/2$)

- pion sigma terms are implemented in fit analysis, however, i am not prepared to quote them as accurate at present. 

- To what precision do we need to compute FV corrections? 


Andre: 
- $w_0/a$ data 

Nolan:
- updated scale setting bs code is complete 
- updated scale_setting.p file is complete
