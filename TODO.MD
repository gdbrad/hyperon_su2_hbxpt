- agree on fits then bs hyperon corrs 

- d_de_lam_chi shoud be different for each hyperon 
- mutlifitter base class should only use keys that occur in the xdata and pop all others thus avoiding key error 
- strange sigma term expressions for each hyperon in notes 
- strange sigma term computation in code 
- x


- fitting hyperons simult with nucleon/delta system is nearly impossible to obtain a quality value greater than ~0. 
  - can this be due to using the same fit range 
- learn how to use sys and os commands to search around file trees and grab inputs, cat complete analyses 
- is there a reason to normalize the hyperon correlator data when fit simultaneously together?
